# 🌍 GreenLedger: Decentralized Carbon Credit Rewards

GreenLedger is a blockchain-powered platform that brings **transparency, accountability, and gamification** to sustainability efforts.  
Businesses log eco-friendly actions such as tree planting, renewable energy usage, or recycling, and earn **tokenized carbon credits (CCT)** that are **recorded immutably on-chain**.  
To encourage participation, companies unlock **NFT badges** (Bronze, Silver, Gold) as they achieve milestones, making climate action both **verifiable and engaging**.
